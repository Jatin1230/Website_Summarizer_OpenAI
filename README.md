# Website_Summarizer_OpenAI

In this project we have made a Website Summarizer, means the user only have to paste the link of a specific website in which they wish to have a short summary about. The model will itself create a short and accurate summary after analysing the website content. We have used OpenAI_api_key  and GPT_4o_mini as LLM to help our model generate data accurately, you can use GPT4 or other models to increase the model's accuracy.

NOTE:This is only a rough framework, soon i will making a suitable UI for it using HTML and CSS.
